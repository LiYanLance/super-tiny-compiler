# The Compiler

All the steps of compiler are in src directory, the compiler.js file just combine them in order.

## Setup

No need.

## Run

```
node compiler.js
```

Sorry, there is no test and CLI. You need to modify the variable `input` if you want it to compile other code.

## Test

As I mentioned before, no. But you can get it in original link up there.
